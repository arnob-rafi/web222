          top-selling candy bar here ever since. "

          treat, with peanuts and pretzels baked into "caramelized creme." Unfortunately, a Reddit
          user who visited the Hershey factory in early 2020 asked about this bar, and was told it's
          no longer in production..

          chocolate to be sour), the Cookies 'n' Creme is similar in taste to an Oreo (and is one of
          the few white chocolate candy bar success stories).
